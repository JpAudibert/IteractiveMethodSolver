# IteractiveMethodSolver

## Description
A simple, yet powerful, method of solving equations with multiple variables without scaling

## Incentive
Part of the discipline of linear algebra and analytic geometry, 
taught by professor MÃ¡rcia Jussara Hepp.

## Explanation
The proposal is to create a system to replace the Excel spreadsheets 
provided to streamline calculations using the iterative methods of 
Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi.
